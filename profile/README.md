# Introduction

PagoPA's software repositories are organized in two GitHub organizations:
- the active projects are maintained in the [**@pagopa**](https://github.com/pagopa) organization;
- this organization is used to store the **archived** projects.

As such, this is a **read-only** organization, so all the repositories stored here are marked as *Public Archive*. This means that the repositories are not editable and all their features, e.g. issues, pull requests, wiki, are disabled.


## Contacts
Should you have any inquiry regarding the archived projects, please open an issue in [this repository](https://github.com/pagopa-archive/.github/issues).
